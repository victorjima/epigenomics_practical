# epigenomics_practical
This repository contains my epigenomics practical analysing ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data from ENCODE to find distal regulatory regions in sigmoid colon and stomach tissues.

In this repository are available:
  - This README.txt file
  - The get.distance.py script modified as it has been used to perform tasks 5.5 & 5.6
  - A mean.R script to compute the mean in task 5.7
  - Both ATAC.peaks bed files from  outside genes obtained at the end of the first part
  - Both regulatoryElements files obtained after task 5.7	
  - In the wiki a report with code and explanations may be accessed
